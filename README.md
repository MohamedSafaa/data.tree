# data.tree
An R package to manage hierarchical data and tree structures

data.tree is to hierarchical data what data.frame is to tabular data. You can create tree structures from hierarchical data, and use the utility methods to traverse the tree in various orders. You can also aggregate, print, convert to and from data.frame, and apply functions to your tree data.
