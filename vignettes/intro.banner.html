Abraham Lincoln once said: Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

My aunt Theresia used to say: If you dream of a forest, you'd better learn how to plant a tree.

I say: No matter if you are a lumberjack or a tree hugger, let data.tree be your axe and your seed.
