While preparing this example, I asked my nine year old daughter: "Ana√Øs, imagine you have a basket full of mushrooms. How would you go about finding out which ones are poisonous?"
<br>"Dad, why would I want to know?", she replies rolling her eyes. "No matter if they are poisonous or not, they are <b>dis-gust-ing</b>."
<br>"OK, fair enough", I sigh, "wrong daughter." 
<br>"Naomi", I turn to my seven year old, "how could you find out if a mushroom is poisonous?" 
<br>"Well", she says. "I'd just eat it. If I die, it's poisonous." 
<br>"But, common, there must be a better way! Think, please!"
<br>"Think? I'm <b>playing</b>. Ask mom if you must!", she groans.
<br>So I do.
<br>"Mushrooms? Where did you buy them?", my wife asks back. 
<br>"Good question, but ... it doesn't matter." 
<br>"No Sir, it <b>does</b> matter!"
<br>"Why?", I ask dubiously.
<br>"I'd have to to know if they are <b>organic</b>, obviously".
<br>"Eh, why? ... I don't know... well, whatever, ... so, fine, assume I found them in the forest, so they are all organic.", I reply in exasperation.
<br>"Aha!", she jubilates triumphantly, "that makes it easy! If they are organic, they simply <b>must</b> be good for you. Hence they simply <b>cannot</b> be poisonous!" 
<br>Quod erat whatever.
