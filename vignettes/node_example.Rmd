## About Trees

Trees are ubiquitious is mathematics, computer science, data sciences, finance, and in many other fields. Trees are useful always when we are facing hierarchies. Some examples where trees are useful:

* in decision theory (c.f. decision trees)
* in finance, e.g. to classify financial instruments into asset classes
* in routing algorithms
* in computer science and programming (e.g. binary search trees, xml)
* e.g. for family trees

R provides some tree-like structures on various low levels. For example, environments can be seen as nodes in a tree. Also, R provides various packages that deal with tree-like structures (especially in the area of decision theory). Yet, there is no high-level tree data structure that could be used equally conveniently and generically as, say, data.frame. 

As a consequence, people often try to resolve hierarchical problems in a tabular fashion, for instance with data.frames (or in Excel sheets). But hierarchies don't marry with tables and various workarounds are usually required. 

This package tries to offer an alternative. The tree package allows creating hierarchies by the use of the Node object. Node provides basic traversal and search operations. You can decorate Nodes with attributes and methods, by that extending the package to your needs. 

Also, the package provides convenience methods to print trees nicely, and to convert it to a data.frame for integration with other packages.

## Tree Creation

Let's start by creating a tree of nodes. In our example, we are looking at a company, Acme Inc., and the tree reflects its oranisational structure. The root (level 0) is the company. On level 1, the nodes represent departments, and the leaves of the tree represent projects the company considers for next year:

```{r}
library(ahp)
acme <- Node$new("Acme Inc.")
  accounting <- acme$AddChild("Accounting")
    software <- accounting$AddChild("New Software")
    standards <- accounting$AddChild("New Accounting Standards")
  research <- acme$AddChild("Research")
    newProductLine <- research$AddChild("New Product Line")
    newLabs <- research$AddChild("New Labs")
  it <- acme$AddChild("IT")
    outsource <- it$AddChild("Outsource")
    agile <- it$AddChild("Go agile")
    goToR <- it$AddChild("Switch to R")

print(acme)
  
```
## Custom Attributes

Now, let's associate some costs with the projects:
```{r}
software$cost <- 1000000
standards$cost <- 500000
newProductLine$cost <- 2000000
newLabs$cost <- 750000
outsource$cost <- 400000
agile$cost <- 250000
goToR$cost <- 50000

```
And some probabilities that the projecs will be executed in the next year:

```{r}
software$p <- 0.5
standards$p <- 0.75
newProductLine$p <- 0.25
newLabs$p <- 0.9
outsource$p <- 0.2
agile$p <- 0.05
goToR$p <- 1

```

## Converting to data.frame

We can now convert the tree into a `data.frame`:

```{r}
acmedf <- as.data.frame(acme)
acmedf

```
Adding the cost as a column to our `data.frame` is easy, by using the `Get` method. We'll explain the `Get` method in more detail below.
```{r}
acmedf$level <- acme$Get("level")
acmedf$cost <- acme$Get("cost")
acmedf
```

We could have achieved the same result in one go:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
as.data.frame(acme, "level", "cost")
```

Internally, the same is called when printing a tree:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(acme, "level", "cost")
```


### Using Get when converting to data.frame and for printing

Above, we saw how we can add the name of an attribute to the ellipsis argument of the as.data.frame. However, we can also add the results of the `Get` method directly to the `as.data.frame` . This allows for example formatting the column in a specific way. Details of the Get method are explained in the next section.

```{r}

as.data.frame(acme, 
              "level",
              probability = acme$Get("p", format = FormatPercent)
             )
                        

```



## Get Method

Tree traversal is one of the core concepts of trees. See for example here: [Tree Traversal on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal).
The Get Method traverses the tree, and collects values from each node. It then returns a vector containing the collected values. 

Additional features of the Get Method are:
* execute a function on each node, and append the function's result to the returned vector
* execute a Node Method on each node, and append the Method's return value to the reuturned vector
* assign the function or method return value to a Node's attribute



### Traversal Order

The `Get` method can traverse the tree in various ways. This is called traversal order.

#### Pre-Order

The default traversal mode is **pre-order**. 

![pre-order](assets/preorder.png)

This is what is used e.g. in the `as.data.frame` method:

```{r}
as.data.frame(acme, "level")

data.frame(level = acme$Get('level'))

```

#### Post-Order

The **post-order** traversal mode first returns children, and parents only when all children have been traversed:

![post-order](assets/postorder.png)

We can use it like this on the `Get` method:

```{r}
data.frame(level = acme$Get('level', traversal = "post-order"))
```

This is useful if your parent's value depends on the children.

#### Ancestor

This is a non-standard traversal mode that does not traverse the entire tree. Instead, the ancestor mode starts from a node, and then walks the tree along the path from ancestor to ancestor, up to the root:

```{r}

data.frame(level = agile$Get('level', traversal = "ancestor"))

```

### Get using a function

#### Pass a function to the Get method

You can pass a standard R function to the `Get` method. For example:

```{r}

ExpectedCost <- function(node) {
  result <- node$cost * node$p
  if(length(result) == 0) result <- NA
  return (result)
}

data.frame(acme$Get(ExpectedCost))

```

The requirement for the function (`ExpectedCost` in the above example) is that:
* the first argument of the function is a Node
* it needs to return a scalar


#### Using Recursion

In the following examples, we use `magrittr` to enhance readability of the code. 

```{r}
library(magrittr)
ExpectedCost <- function(node) {
  result <- node$cost * node$p
  if(length(result) == 0) {
    if (node$isLeaf) result <- NA
    else {
      node$children %>% sapply(ExpectedCost) %>% sum -> result
    }
  }
  return (result)
}

data.frame(ec = acme$Get(ExpectedCost))

```

#### Add Parameters to the Passed Function

The Traverse method accepts an ellipsis `...`. Any additional parameters with which `Get` is called will be passed on the the `ExpectedCost` function: This gives us more flexibility. For instance, we don't have to hard-code the `sum` function into `ExpectedCost`, but we can leave it to the caller to provide the function to use:

```{r}

ExpectedCost <- function(node, fun = sum) {
  result <- node$cost * node$p
  if(length(result) == 0) {
    if (node$isLeaf) result <- NA
    else {
      node$children %>% sapply(function(x) ExpectedCost(x, fun = fun)) %>% fun -> result
    }
  }
  return (result)
}

data.frame(ec = acme$Get(ExpectedCost, fun = mean))

```


### Assigning values using Get

We can tell the Get method to assign the value to a specific attribute for each Node it traverses. This is especially useful if the attribute parameter is a function, as in the previous examples :

```{r}

acme$Get(function(x) x$p * x$cost, assign = "expectedCost")
print(acme, "p", "cost", "expectedCost")

```


### Combine Assignment and Calculation

In the above Recursion example, we recurse for each node to all descendants straight to the leaf, by that repeating the same calculations various times.

We can avoid these repetitious calculations by piggy-backing on pre-calculated values. Obviously, this requires us to traverse the tree in post-order mode: We want to start calculating at the leafes, and then walk back towards the root.

In the following example, we calculate the average expected cost. As this depends now only of a node's children, and because we walk the tree in post-order mode, we can be sure that our children have the value calculated when we traverse the parent.


```{r}

ExpectedCost <- function(node, variableName = "avgExpectedCost", fun = sum) {
  #if the "cache" is filled, I return it. This stops the recursion
  if(!is.null(node[[variableName]])) return (node[[variableName]])
  
  #otherwise, I calculate from my own properties
  result <- node$cost * node$p
  
  #if the properties are not set, I calculate the mean from my children
  if(length(result) == 0) {
    if (node$isLeaf) result <- NA
    else {
      node$children %>%
      sapply(function(x) ExpectedCost(x, variableName = variableName, fun = fun)) %>%
      fun -> result
    }
  }
  return (result)
}

acme$Get(ExpectedCost, fun = mean, traversal = "post-order", assign = "avgExpectedCost")

print(acme, "cost", "p", "avgExpectedCost")

```

### Formatting Get

We can pass a formatting function to the `Get` method, which will convert the returned value to a human readable string for printing. 

```{r}

PrintMoney <- function(x) {
  format(x, digits=10, nsmall=2, decimal.mark=".", big.mark="'", scientific = FALSE)
}

print(acme, cost = acme$Get("cost", format = PrintMoney))

```

Note that the format is not used for assignment with the assign parameter, but only for the values returned by `Get`:

```{r}
acme$Get("cost", format = PrintMoney, assign = "cost2")
print(acme, cost = acme$Get("cost2"))
```



## Set Method

The `Set` method is the counterpart to the `Get` method. It takes a vector or a single value as an input, and traverses the tree in a certain order. Each node is assigned a value from the vector.

### Assigning Values


```{r}
employees <- c(NA, 52, NA, NA, 78, NA, NA, 39, NA, NA, NA)
acme$Set(employees)
print(acme, "employees")
```

The Set method can take multiple vectors as an input, and optionally you can define the name of the attribute:

```{r}
secretaries <- c(NA, 5, NA, NA, 6, NA, NA, 2, NA, NA, NA)
acme$Set(secretaries, secPerEmployee = secretaries/employees)
print(acme, "employees", "secretaries", "secPerEmployee")


```


Just as for the `Get` method, the **traversal order** is important for the `Set`.

Often, it is usefule to use `Get` and `Set` together:

```{r}
ec <- acme$Get(function(x) x$p * x$cost)
acme$Set(expectedCost = ec)
print(acme, "p", "cost", "expectedCost")

```

### Deleting Attributes

The Set method can also be used to assign a single value directly. For example, to remove the avgExpectedCost, we assign NULL on each node like this:

```{r}
acme$Set(avgExpectedCost = NULL)
```

### Chaining

Note that we can also chain the arguments:

```{r}
acme$Set(avgExpectedCost = NULL)$Set(expectedCost = NA)
print(acme, "avgExpectedCost", "expectedCost")
```

This is equivalent to:
```{r}
acme$Set(avgExpectedCost =NULL, expectedCost = NA)
```


### A Word on Null and NA

Also note that setting a value to NA or to NULL looks equivalent when printing to a data.frame, but internally it is not:

```{r}
acme$avgExpectedCost
acme$expectedCost


```

The reason is that NULL is always converted to NA for printing, and when using the Get method.


## Aggregate

For simple cases, you don't have to write your own function to pass along to the Get method. For example, the Aggregate method provides a shorthand for the often used case when a parent is the aggregate of its children values:

```{r}

acme$Aggregate("cost", sum)

```

We can use this in the Get method:

```{r}
acme$Get("Aggregate", "cost", sum)
```

This is equivalent of:

```{r}

GetCost <- function(node) {
  result <- node$cost
  if(length(result) == 0) {
    if (node$isLeaf) stop(paste("Cost for ", node$name, " not available!"))
    else {
      node$children %>% sapply(GetCost) %>% sum -> result
    }
  }
  return (result)
}

acme$Get(GetCost)

```


## Sorting

You can sort an entire tree by using the Sort method on the root. The method will sort recursively and, for each node, sort the children by a child attribute. As before, the child attribute can also be a function or a method (e.g. of a sub class of Node, see below).

```{r}
acme$Get(ExpectedCost, assign = "expectedCost")
acme$Sort("expectedCost", decreasing = TRUE)
print(acme, "expectedCost")
```

Naturally, you can also sort a subtree by calling Sort on the subtree's root node.


## Subclassing Node

We can create a subclass of Node, and add custom methods to our subclass. This is very natural to users with experience in OO languages such as Java, Python or C#:


```{r}
library(R6)
MyNode <- R6Class("MyNode",
                    inherit = Node,
                    lock = FALSE,
                    
                    #public fields and function
                    public = list(
                        p = NULL, 
                        cost = NULL,
                        AddChild = function(name) {
                          child <- MyNode$new(name)
                          invisible (self$AddChildNode(child))
                        }
                    ),
                    
                    #active
                    active = list(
                      expectedCost = function() {
                        if ( is.null(self$p) || is.null(self$cost)) return (NULL)
                        self$p * self$cost                    
                      }
                    )
                )

```

The AddChild utility function in the subclass allows us to construct the tree just as before.

The expectedCost function is now a Method, and we can call it in a more R6-ish way.
