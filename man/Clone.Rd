\title{Clone a tree (creates a deep copy)}
\usage{
Clone(node)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{the root node of the tree or sub-tree to clone}
}
\value{
the clone of the tree
}
\description{
The method also clones object attributes (such as the formatters). If the tree
does not contain formatters, you might want to use the R6 method node$clone() instead,
as it is a bit faster. However, node$clone() will not copy object attributes.

\examples{
data(acme)
acmeClone <- Clone(acme)
acmeClone$name <- "New Acme"
# acmeClone does not point to the same reference object anymore:
acme$name
}
