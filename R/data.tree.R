#' data.tree hierarchical data for R
#' 
#' Hierarchical data is ubiquitous. However, no general-use tree data structure is available in R,
#' similar to, say, data.frame for tabular data. This package allows building trees of hierarchical
#' data, traverse the trees and run operations on nodes or collect data. The package also contains 
#' utility functions to sort, to print, and to construct a tree from a data.frame and vice versa.
