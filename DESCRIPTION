Description: This package is to hierarchical data what data.frame is to tabular data. You can create 
    tree structures from hierarchical data, and use the utility methods to traverse the tree in 
    various orders. You can also aggregate, print, convert to and from data.frame, and apply functions
    to your tree data.
